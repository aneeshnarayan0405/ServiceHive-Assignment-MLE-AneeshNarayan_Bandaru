# Technical Report: Scene Analysis System

## Executive Summary

This technical report documents the implementation of an Intelligent Scene Analysis System developed for the ServiceHive Machine Learning Engineer assignment. The system successfully classifies natural-scene images into six categories, generates descriptive captions, and provides uncertainty estimates through a RESTful API service.

## 1. Problem Statement

The project required building a comprehensive system that:
1. Classifies natural-scene images into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street
2. Generates short, scene-appropriate descriptions for each prediction
3. Returns confidence scores and uncertainty estimates
4. Exposes these capabilities via a REST API with Docker deployment

## 2. Dataset and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Dataset Overview
- **Source**: Intel Image Classification dataset from Kaggle
- **Size**: 25,000 JPEG images (150×150 pixels)
- **Classes**: 6 balanced categories (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street)
- **Split**: 14,000 training images, 3,000 validation images, 7,000 test images

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
```python
# Image normalization and augmentation
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=20,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    validation_split=0.2
)
```

**Augmentation Strategies**:
- Random rotations (±20 degrees)
- Width and height shifts (20% range)
- Horizontal flipping
- Zoom augmentation (20% range)
- Normalization to [0, 1] range

### 3.2 Transfer Learning with EfficientNetB0
```python
# Base model with frozen weights
base_model = EfficientNetB0(include_top=False, 
                           weights='imagenet', 
                           input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
base_model.trainable = False

# Custom classification head
x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
x = Dropout(0.2)(x)
outputs = Dense(6, activation='softmax')(x)
```

### 3.3 Training Strategy
**Advanced Techniques Implemented**:
1. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: ReduceLROnPlateau with factor=0.2, patience=5
2. **Early Stopping**: Restore best weights with patience=10
3. **Batch Normalization**: Accelerate training and improve stability
4. **Dropout Regularization**: 0.5 dropout rate in dense layers
5. **Fine-tuning**: Unfreezing base model layers after initial training

**Hyperparameters**:
- Batch size: 32
- Initial learning rate: 0.001
- Fine-tuning learning rate: 1e-5
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

## 4. Performance Evaluation

### 4.1 Model Performance Metrics

| Model | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Custom CNN | 82.3% | 78.2% | 76.8% |
| EfficientNetB0 (Frozen) | 94.1% | 92.5% | 91.2% |
| EfficientNetB0 (Fine-tuned) | 96.7% | 94.3% | 93.1% |

### 4.2 Confusion Matrix Analysis

The EfficientNetB0 model demonstrated strong performance across all classes:
- **Highest accuracy**: Glacier and sea classes (96-97%)
- **Most confusion**: Between buildings and street scenes
- **Per-class precision**: Ranged from 89% (buildings) to 97% (glacier)

### 4.3 Training Curves

Both models showed:
- Smooth convergence without significant overfitting
- Validation curves closely tracking training curves
- Effective learning rate reduction when validation loss plateaued

## 5. Multi-Modal Integration

### 5.1 Uncertainty Estimation
Implemented Monte Carlo Dropout for Bayesian uncertainty estimation:
```python
def predict_with_uncertainty(model, image, n_iter=50):
    predictions = np.stack([model(image, training=True) for _ in range(n_iter)])
    mean_prediction = np.mean(predictions, axis=0)
    uncertainty = np.std(predictions, axis=0)
    return np.argmax(mean_prediction), mean_prediction[0, predicted_class], uncertainty[0, predicted_class]
```

**Uncertainty Insights**:
- Low uncertainty (<0.05): Clear, unambiguous scenes
- Medium uncertainty (0.05-0.15): Mixed or transitional scenes
- High uncertainty (>0.15): Ambiguous or poorly captured images

### 5.2 Scene Description Generation
Integrated OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for natural language generation:
```python
def generate_scene_description(predicted_class, api_key):
    prompt = f"Generate a very short, single-sentence description of a {predicted_class} scene..."
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
    return response.choices[0].message['content'].strip()
```

**Prompt Engineering**:
- Specific instructions to avoid "image" and "photo" terms
- Constrained to single-sentence outputs
- Focus on descriptive, alt-text style descriptions
- Fallback descriptions for API failure scenarios

```

**Endpoints**:

}
```

### 6.3 Docker Containerization
